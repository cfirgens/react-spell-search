## About

This project uses https://open5e.com/api-docs API to get Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition SRD spells and allows the user to search by name of the spell or a specific class to see spells used by that class.

The user is then returned a list of spells that matches the name and is given that spells information. The user can then click on the spell to get additional information.
